# To Do

**Required:**

- [x] ~~Userify (register/login user)~~
- [x] ~~Humanify (create human)~~
  - [x] select human (consider implementation strategy: pass in session/cookie like user)

**Do:**
- [ ] Pixel Farm
- [ ] Letter
- [ ] Code (docs for an API, publicly accessible, easy-mode as possible, walk them through it, starting with "open bash, curl https://humans.game/api GET, see next instructions via the gd API Game lol that results in apps (and other unforeseen emergent value systems) ")

***TMI:** There is no such thing as "Creation". Int. serves only to mold the existing, to translate the values in the "Emergent (Value) System". Or is it actually possible to produce a system that GIVES MORE THAN IT TAKES? (Must separate from the collective ignorance to explore this one. Too many myopic "obviously yes"s miss the fundamental-existential-level at which "yes" is a near-impossibility) Moving on...*
