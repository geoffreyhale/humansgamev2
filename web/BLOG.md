## Existential Checklist

**TMI:** Started humans.game v2 by cloning 130words which includes (User-)identity, persistence (Doctrine, sql).

**TLDR:**

 - [x] Concept (conceptual seed)
 - [x] Existence (2017-11-22)
 - [x] Identity
 - [x] Persistence
 - [ ] Value
 - [ ] Ownership (Human ownership of value)
 - [ ] Market (value exchange)
 - [ ] Emergence...

### Value

**Experience of:**
 - [ ] Growth (e.g. from Farming growing Human's Inventory / share of Farming Map)
 - [ ] Power/Influence
 - [ ] Belongingness/Community
 - [ ] Pleasure
 - [x] Novelty/Ingenuity/Intrigue
 - [ ] Challenge/Puzzle/Accomplishment

**Emergent Value Systems**

Build systems that yield emergent value.

- [ ] Farming

#### Farming

**TMI:** Farming := producing sustenance supports (/ is req by/for) "persistence"/User-existence.

Using minimal emergent system to simulate a farm-like experience might be like:

##### Pixel Farm

1. human selects one pixel per day on shared map
   - (select = "plant" (gain pixel ownership, lose "seed" from inventory))
   - (pixel = "seed" (seed-container))
2. - can select iff adjacent to existing pixel
3. (Inventory (ability to **has**) and) "Harvesting"  - ability to retrieve planted crops.
4. Enable experience of (human- (inventory- (value- ))) **growth**:
   - "harvesting" ONE (("ripe"?) pixel) yields TWO
5. Harvesting removes pixel ownership
   - Allows recycling, and relocation with consolidation.
     - Example: If you're pixel is surrounded by other farms, you can harvest your pixel and go plant all your pixels out at the edge of the map.
       - Expect emergent result: human-driven content-organizing expanding 2D map (pixel farm).
         - (title: Pixel Farm)
       - (good misplaced idea: in future ripeness implementation yields: one if unripe, 2 if ripe)

#### Record Keeping

**TMI:** *Record Keeping IRL is an example of another Emergent Value System (EVS).  It is both the result of an EVS (humanity IRL) as well as itself an EVS (resulting in text like this, or code like this from which the Humans.Game emerges).  **TMI:** First appearance of "Humans.Game" (title case, periodized).*

##### Letter

A minimal emergent system of human-emergent record keeping shall be as:

- Persistent (obviously, inherently)
- Universal (only one total documents of this type exist and it is exposed to all humans).
- Gamified (e.g. iff you didn't add previous character: allow human to append only one character)
  - later versions: allow purchase of adding a character
     - in-game money <--> (or) $ IRL (<--> any **transactable value** (e.g. crypto-currency (e.g. Bitcoin, **Ethereum**), goods, services, etc))
        - (an original conceptual point of core value for humans.game [https://humans.game] was as optimized universal extensible value exchange system (universal **market**), but that ultimately led me to follow inspiration of **emergence**) 
          - (another case in point of (digressive) record keeping) ;)
- Name the game: Letter
    - add letter(s)
    - Letter emerges (like a letter consisting of multiple words/sentences)
        - Embaracements of language, e.g.
            - letter(s) < ~~word < sentence < paragraph < body < ~~letter (doh!)~~ Letter

### Emergence

#### Code (API)

(docs for an API, publicly accessible, easy-mode as possible, walk them through it, starting with "open bash, curl https://humans.game/api GET, see next instructions via the gd API Game lol that results in apps (and other unforeseen emergent value systems) ")

***TMI:** There is no such thing as "Creation". Int. serves only to mold the existing, to translate the values in the "Emergent (Value) System". Or is it actually possible to produce a system that GIVES MORE THAN IT TAKES? (Must separate from the collective ignorance to explore this one. Too many myopic "obviously yes"s miss the fundamental-existential-level at which "yes" is a near-impossibility) Moving on...*
